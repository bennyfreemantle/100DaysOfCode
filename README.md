# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Start date: 26/09/2022

### Day 1:

**Today's Progress**: psuedo-classes are tricky!

**Thoughts:** Today was my first day starting The School of Code cohort 13. As well as my 1/100 days of code. Playing around and completing all [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/) tasks. Pseudo-classes are tricky! I found working backwards helped understand them a little better. Nevertheless will likely still require mdn lookups for future usage.
