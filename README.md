# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Start date: 26/09/2022

### Day 1:

**Today's Progress**: psuedo-classes are tricky!

**Thoughts:** Today was my first day starting The School of Code cohort 13. As well as my 1/100 days of code. Playing around and completing all [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/) tasks. Pseudo-classes are tricky! I found working backwards helped understand them a little better. Nevertheless will likely still require mdn lookups for future usage.

### Day 2:

**Today's Progress**: Git commands & Hack The Galaxy

**Thoughts:** learned a few more Git commands and was humbled very quickly with the Hack The Galaxy problems. Critical and computational thinking is a skill I will undoubtable need to work on. Luckily, throughout my journey with SoC I will be exposed to plenty more problems to try and solve which i will carry through into my career.

### Day 3:

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript basics

**Thoughts:** Had a refresh on the JavaScript basics. Primitive types, functions and loops. Created a very basic password checking system with 3 tries and you’re out. Finally, helping others, helps me ALOT.

---

### Day 4:

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript basics continued

**Thoughts:** How to approach receiving / giving feedback & the importance it has.
Refresher on JS Objects and Arrays & how to add, remove, read and update them.
Polishing up on the pair programming git clone, add, commit, push, pull work flow.

## Key Concepts

- Objects can be accessed with either . or [ ] notation
- Can only reference object key’s that are Numbers with [ ] notation as . would cause a syntax error
- As mentioned above with Array's the indexes are always numbers so we use [ ] notation when trying to access array values.

```js
let myArray = ["Hello", "World"];
myArray.1; // Syntax error
myArray[1]; // World
```

- Arrays start at index 0
- You would loop over an Array with a for loop 99% of the time instead of a while loop.
- typeof []= “object”
- Because Arrays are Objects they have ‘pre-baked’ methods and properties you can use out of the box.

```js
// Declare an array
let array = [];

// Add to an array
array[0] = "hello"; // update at index 0
array.push("world"); // add onto the end of the array
array.unshift("before"); // add at the start of the array

// Remove from an array
array.pop(); // remove from the end of an array
array.shift(); // remove from the start of an array

// remove from a defined starting index in the array
// 0 = the index to start removing items from
// 1 = how many items to remove
array.splice(0, 1);

// Declare an object
const object = {
  age: 25,
};

// Add a key:value pair into an object
// Can also be used to update an exisiting value
object.myName = "ben";
// Remove from a key:value pair from an object
delete object.age;
```

### Day 5:

**Today's Progress**: Hackathon Friday

**Thoughts:** Our first Hackathon working as a pair. Pushing and pulling our changes to each other, taking it in turns to write up each task.

## Key Concepts

- Push, pulling git workflow is picking up speed
- Plan, plan, plan.
- Google is your friend, always ask it for help.

### Day 6:

**Today's Progress**: Finishing [Hackathon Project](https://github.com/bennyfreemantle/w1_hackathon_rock-paper-scissors-git-test) & Refactoring

**Thoughts:** Refactoring code is frustrating. Finished Rock paper scissors app on my own forked repo. At times I wasn't sure why it wasn't working, breaking it down and trying another way helped alot. I kept making silly mistakes by leaving old variables and function calls which caused my app to behave in unexpected ways. Even if the code was logically correct.

## Key Concepts

- Functions doing only 1 thing
- losing my mind after an hour of debugging it was because I had called the function twice…


#### Extension 2: The Clairvoyant Computer plan / pseudo-code
```js
// Extentsion 2: The Clairvoyant Computer
/**
 * How would you go about making the computer win every time ?
 * 
 * You could change the way the computer chooses it's option
 * instead of choosing based on a random number, it would know what you had chosen before
 * by reading your value first.
 * It would then choose the 'opposite' option to beat you everytime
 * 
 * you could store these 'opposite' pairings in an object
 * 
 * let clairvoyant = {
 *  rock: 'paper',
 *  paper: 'scissors',
 *  scissors: 'rock'
 * }
 * 
 * The computer would then access clairvoyant.userChoice as the computers choice
 * so it would always choose the 'opposite' that beats the player 100% of the time
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * How would you go about making it so that the computer wins more often
 * 1/2 the time, 1/4 of the time, 90% of the time ?
 * 
 * using the implementation above, you could now add a random number generator
 * to decide if its going to 'cheat' or not cheat. It's always the computer that gets
 * to decide if they win or lose. And not luck.
 * 
 * random number 0 - 1 : cheat - don't cheat = 1/2 chance
 * random number 0 - 3 : cheat - don't cheat = 1/4 chance
 *  random number 0 - 9 : cheat - don't cheat
 *  for 90% you would need to inverse the odd's so if the roll was between 0 - 8
 *  the computer would win, 9 rolls = 90%
 *  if the roll was 9 and only 9 the computer would let the player win giving the player
 *  10% win chance.
 * 
 */
```

### Day 7:

**Today's Progress**: Rest & Research

**Thoughts:** Slow day today, mostly recapping what I did last week and researching string and array methods and how to use them.

## Key Concepts

- forEach array loop
- slice() string method extracting specific parts
- replace() as the name suggests, replaces some or all that match a pattern

---

### Day 8:

**Today's Progress**: The JavaScript DOM

**Thoughts:** The DOM is a JavaScript object representation of HTML, and not the HTML itself. It can be manipulated in many ways. Reading, writing, adding & deleting elements.

## Key Concepts

- How to read, write, delete and add elements from the DOM
- querySelectorAll() method returns an ‘array like’ object called a NodeList
- You can iterate over the NodeList and execute code on each item. Just like you can with an array.
- console.dir() function is useful to visualise and see the object and all it’s properties
    - displays an interactive list of the properties of the specified JavaScript object.

```js
// Point to the html #user-name and store the result into userName variable
let userName = document.querySelector('#user-name');

// Update the textContent of userName to = 'ben'
userName.textContent = 'Ben';

// Create a new element
let newDiv = document.createElement('div');

// Change / add content to the the new div
newDiv.textContent = "I'm a fresh new div element";

// Append the div to the body (will append as the last child)
document.body.appendChild(newDiv);

// Remove the div from the DOM
document.body.removeChild(newDiv);

```
