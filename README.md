# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Start date: 26/09/2022

### Day 1:

**Today's Progress**: psuedo-classes are tricky!

**Thoughts:** Today was my first day starting The School of Code cohort 13. As well as my 1/100 days of code. Playing around and completing all [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/) tasks. Pseudo-classes are tricky! I found working backwards helped understand them a little better. Nevertheless will likely still require mdn lookups for future usage.

### Day 2:

**Today's Progress**: Git commands & Hack The Galaxy

**Thoughts:** learned a few more Git commands and was humbled very quickly with the Hack The Galaxy problems. Critical and computational thinking is a skill I will undoubtable need to work on. Luckily, throughout my journey with SoC I will be exposed to plenty more problems to try and solve which i will carry through into my career.
